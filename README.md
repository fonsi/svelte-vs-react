# Svelte vs React Examples

In this project you can find some simple components created in Svelte and the same components created in React.

The examples are in the src folder. Inside each of them is the code of each of the components in both Svelte and React.

To run the examples you can do:
```
npm start
```
This will start a server in your localhost -> http://localhost:9000/
